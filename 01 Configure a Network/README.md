# BeCode Group Project #1

**Duration:** 4 days
**Deadline:** 25/10/2024
**Group Members:** Serena, St√©phane & Maureen

## Project context

Your company faces an exciting challenge: designing a secure and efficient network for a client relocating to a new office. Their current setup requires modernization, and you're tasked with crafting a cost-effective, well-structured plan that optimizes resource allocation while adhering to stringent security best practices.

## Must have

Firewall Simulation: While Packet Tracer may not fully support advanced firewall configuration, we'll implement alternative security measures.

Client Requirements:
    - DNS server
    - DHCP server
    - DMZ concept implemented through VLANs and access control lists (ACLs) (firewall alternative)
    - iSCSI storage server
    - Four network sectors:
        - Management/Secretariat (5 workstations)
        - Study (8 workstations)
        - Production (10 workstations)
        - Support (2 sectors, 10 workstations each)

## Deliverables:

- Packet Tracer Network: Share your network configuration file for evaluation.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Create a detailed PDF or Word document describing the network design, including:
    - Network diagram with annotations.
    - IP addressing table per sector and VLAN (if used).
    - Configuration details for key devices.
    - Explanation of security measures and their purpose.
    - Cost breakdown of network components.
- Group Presentation: Deliver a 10-minute presentation explaining your design choices and security considerations. Ensure all team members participate.
